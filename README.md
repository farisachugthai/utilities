# utilities

This repository houses a number of functional scripts I utilize to
administer multiple workstations.

Quite honestly, it basically started with me saying 'Hey it'd be nice to
have a script do this for me.' every now and then.

That continued until I had enough scripts I was happy with to make a git repo
for them!

## Usage

Modules can be used to:

- Back up directories
- Automate the process of downloading plain-text files from the Internet.
- Automate downloading videos from YouTube
- Symlink files recursively
- Inspect varying python modules.
- Introspect environment variables.
- Profiling nvim startup time.
- Strip trailing whitespace from a file.

## Contributions

Even though these are mostly scripts I've thrown together;
I'd absolutely love any constructive criticism or
pointers on how to get any module listed to work better!

I hope it goes without saying, but if it doesn't, please don't hesitate
to fork or create an issue.
