# TODO.md

Not too dissimilar to the world's worst kanban board, this file is going to be a
manually created index for every TODO I write in this repo.

I started with a good 'hey that'd be nice to do in the future.' type project.

[remove watermarks from itebook](github.com/ShadonSniper/RemoveWatermark)

But from here and below, it's a list of the all the TODOs I have to go. I'm sure
there's plenty.

In the official python documentation they have a HOW-TO for argparse, and I've
been working through that slowly. As it'll be the easiest place to apply that
knowledge, I want to refactor (python/batch_renamer.py) so that takes one
parameter using argparse.

TODO: Learn the bare minimum of std lib's tempfile module so you can add a
helper function to create files if they don't have a batch they want to rename
[obviously for debugging purposes]

Fix up the snippets in Nvim so that I don't get blocking error messages every
time I enter 'Insert Mode'.

Either add doctests, logging or unittests [idk yet] to (python/dlink.py) so that
you feel confident enough to begin basing (python/dot_sym.ipy) off of it and
then begin basing (github.com/farisachugthai/newbuntu) off of that.
