# TODO.md

Not too dissimilar to the world's worst kanban board, this file is going to be a
manually created index for every TODO I write in this repo.

This repository basically started with saying 'Hey that'd be nice to have'.
That continued until I had enough scripts I was happy with to make a git repo
for them!

- Either add doctests, logging or unittests to
[dlink.py](https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dlink.py) so
that you feel confident enough to begin basing
[dot_sym.ipy](https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dot_sym.ipy)
off of it and then begin basing [newbuntu](https://github.com/farisachugthai/newbuntu)
off of that.

- Make a script that deletes empty dirs in `$PREFIX/tmp.` Termux has 100s now.

- A script that utilizes
[dlink.py](https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dlink.py)
to update the scripts in `~/bin`. Quite annoying to do this manually.

- Rsync and rclone scripts aren't close to done.
part of that will be encrypting/archiving your notebooks and pulling
them down on different devices.
