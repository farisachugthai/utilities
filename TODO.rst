TODO
========

Not too dissimilar to the world's worst kanban board, this file is going
to be a manually created index for every **TODO** I write in this repo.

docs
-----

It's not much but the docs build. However your readme file still renders as
markdown so you'll probably wanna change the file extension there and rewrite
it.

scripts
^^^^^^^^

- Either add doctests, logging or unittests to
`dlink <https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dlink.py>`_
that you feel confident enough to begin basing
`dot_sym.ipy <https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dot_sym.ipy>`_
off of it and then begin basing `newbuntu <https://github.com/farisachugthai/newbuntu>`_
off of that.

- Make a script that deletes empty dirs in `$PREFIX/tmp.`
  Termux has 100s now.

- A script that utilizes
`dlink <https://github.com/farisachugthai/utilities/python/dlink.py>`_
to update the scripts in `~/bin`. Quite annoying to do this manually.

- Rsync and rclone scripts aren't close to done.
Part of that will be encrypting/archiving your notebooks and pulling
them down on different devices.
