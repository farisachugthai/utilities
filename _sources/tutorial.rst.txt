   :synopsis: The pyutils tutorial

This package combines different scripts that aide in working with computers
ranging from Windows 10 to Linux to Ubuntu to automate regular,
repetitive and error prone tasks.

Contributing Tutorial
---------------------
This package has recently adopted the :mod:`numpy` convention for docstrings.
As a result, all docstrings must conform to this standard.


A bare template for a full docstring with all :mod:`numpy` subsections has been
included below.

.. include:: numpydoc_docstring.rst

.. http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#include

In addition, full details of the numpy docstring format are given at :ref:`format`
