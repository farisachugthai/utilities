.. module:: backups
    :synopsis: Move files from the home directory to the dotfiles repo.

All of the following modules are used for creating backups
for files in as painless a way as possible.

:mod:`mv_to_repo`
=================

Move files from the home directory to the dotfiles repo.

.. currentmodule:: mv_to_repo

This is a script I've been using for the better part of a year, so while
the docstring formatting isn't consistent and there are a couple odd
sections, this script has served a very utilitarian purpose.

May refactor one day. But it continues to work.

.. note:: This module assumes a python interpreter above version 3.4.
