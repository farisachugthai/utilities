# rsync exclude/include files

Yo something's definitely wrong with your ftplugin for markdown. When ft=markdown that's when you get those weird fucking newline issues

So let's just leave the list of folders that are automatically excluded.

Here's some inspiration on how to make an

Exclude File:
  From Deja Dup:

    Some locations are always ignored by default:
    ~/.adobe/Flash_Player/AssetCache
    ~/.cache
    ~/.ccache
    ~/.gvfs
    ~/.Private
    ~/.recent-applications.xbel
    ~/.recently-used.xbel
    ~/.steam/root (which by default also ignores ~/.local/share/Steam)
    ~/.thumbnails
    ~/.xsession-errors
    ~/snap/*/*/.cache
    /proc
    /run
    /sys
    /tmp

There's more than likely a ton waiting to be added.

Folders to Include:
This is gonna have annotations basically everywhere because it's probably a good idea to annotate this and debate it.

    "$HOME/.bashrc.d"
Realistically I don't need this backed up it's all in a git repo. Or I could say back it up if it's not a symlink. That'll avoid deduping a git repo but backup all my local files.

Yeah actually do something like that for every folder covered in dotfiles.
    "$HOME/bin"

    "$HOME/.cheat"
Ehhhhh dropbox folders. I mean yes but no. Dropbox isn't going anywhere.
    "$HOME/.config"
Yes plain and simple.
    "$HOME/Documents"
Yes plain and simple.
    "$HOME/.gnupg"
    "$HOME/gpg"
    "$HOME/.kde"
    "$HOME/.mozilla"
    "$HOME/Music"
    "$HOME/Notebooks"
    "$HOME/Pictures"
    "$HOME/projects"
Should this just be a manual process? Or we can designate folders ~/git and ~/src for things that I clone or want to begin working on, and then things get moved to projects when they actually have local changes on them?

Idk. That seems annoying to maintain.

But I wanna have some subdivision of projects, src and random git clones and
idk how to organize things in a sensible manner.
    "$HOME/.ssh"
    "$HOME/ssh"
    "$HOME/Sync"
    "$HOME/Videos"
    "$HOME/.vscode"
    Why? At the very least avoid the dicktons of cache that's probably just sitting around.


Exclude File:

Should have something to the effect of:
./.ipynb_checkpoints/
./*/.ipynb_checkpoints


Once again though an exclude file shouldn't be too necessary as this script should be written in a whitelist fashion.

Probably don't need to backup ~/src; however, it would be a good idea to keep a README in the top level of that dir.
Below the top dir keep a few folders like ~/src/deb, ~/src/apk/ ~/src/appimage and whatever the fuck flatpak uses if anyone still uses that.
Then in the README just keep a running list of things and software that you had and note whether you would want to reinstall it after you spend some time with it.
This is probably also gonna be relevant to anything that's ever in the downloads folder.



Lol is it weird to actually wanna save the cache from neosnippets. Because I just rm -rf'ed .cache and I was a little sad that neosnippets went haha.


Possibly something worth even adding to the newbuntu readme is that if you're going to isntall a new os, consider how you back your old shit up.

Mention rsync. But also mention environments. I use anaconda. {This isn't true but would be good to say} 'I use anaconda and as a result make it a point to run a script htat freezes all of my environments and saves the file. I have this script in my crontab or w/e.
